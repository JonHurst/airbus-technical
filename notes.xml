        <title>Overview</title>
        
        <para>Main processing is carried out by two identical Flight Management Guidance Computers (FMGC) which
        normally work in tandem. Together they are known as the flight management guidance system (FMGS). The pilots
        provide inputs to the FMGS using two Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDUs) on the center pedestal and a
        flight control unit (FCU) on the glare shield.</para>

        <para>The flight management part of the FMGS controls navigation, flight planning, performance optimization,
        predictions and display management. The flight guidance part provides flight director, autopilot and
        auto-thrust commands. The flight augmentation part provides flight envelope computation, maneuvring speed
        computation, windshear detection, &alpha;-floor protection and various yaw functions.</para>

        <para>The FMGCs normally receive information from "on-side" sensors, and communicate between themselves to
        validate data. The FCU feeds both FMGCs.</para>

        <para>The master FMGC is determined by autopilot and/or flight director engagement. FMGC1 is master if AP 1 is
        on, both autopilots are on or both flight directors are on. The autothrust is driven by the master FMGC. The
        flight directors are always driven from their on side FMGC.</para>

        <para>If the cross talk between the two FMGCs is lost, the FMGCs can operate independently. This mode of
        operation is indicated by an amber IND light at the top of each MCDU. In independent mode, the same information
        must be entered into both MCDUs to receive the same guidance.</para>

        <para>In the event of loss of an FMGC, the remaining FMGC continues to operate normally. If the lost FMGC was
        master, the A/P and A/THR will disengage. The AP of the healthy FMGC can be engaged, and subsequently the A/THR
        can be engaged. This situation, known as single mode, is indicated by an amber FM1 light at the top of the MCDU
        on the failed side. The MCDU will now be copy of the MCDU driven by the healthy FMGC. The FMA will annunciate
        e.g. 2FD2 to indicate that both flight directors are being driven from one FMGC. The healthy FMGC also tunes the
        offside navaids. To restore the ND on the failed side, the range and mode must be set identically to that set on
        the healthy side.</para>

        <para>If an FMGC has a software problem, the FMGS will temporarily revert to single mode while the affected FMGC
        auto resets. This may result in autopilot and autothrottle disconnect and reversion to selected modes. MAP NOT
        AVAIL is shown on the ND of the affected side and the status page with a "PLEASE WAIT" message appears on both
        MCDUs. Use of the MCDUs should be avoided during the reset as it will increase the reset time. Reset usually
        takes a few seconds.</para>

        <para>The FCU display is driven by two redundant FCU controllers. A single failure will have very little
        effect. A double FCU failure will lead to the loss of both autopilots, both flight directors and the
        autothrust. The autothrust will revert to thrust locked until the thrust levers are manually moved. All targets
        are lost on the PFD. The EFIS control panels are lost, leading to a reversion to STD, rose NAV 80nm on the
        NDs and a reversion needle selection of VOR1 and ADF2. Weather radar image is also lost.</para>

        <para>A locked MCDU may be recovered by turning it off, then back on after five seconds. This failure is not
        automatically detected. An amber FAIL on the MCDU requires the same procedure.</para>
      </sect2>

        <title>FCU</title>
        <para>{TODO: Add picture of FCU}</para>
        <para>The FCU has two channels, each able to drive the entire FCU.</para>
        <para>In general, turning a knob will select a guidance target and pulling it will then engage a mode to guide
        the aircraft to that target. Pushing a knob, on the other hand, engages a mode managed by the FMGS. When pushed,
        dashes and a white dot appear in the associated window.</para>
        <para>Change over between speed and mach occurs automatically at approximately FL300, although this can be
        overridden with the SPD MACH button.</para>
        <para>The HDG-VS/TRK-FPA button toggles the lateral mode between heading and track and toggles the vertical mode
        between vertical speed and flight path angle. It also toggles the display of the flight path vector (FPV) (or
        "bird") and Flight Path Director (FPD) on the PFDs. FMA lateral mode annunciation are HDG and TRACK
        respectively. The FCU displays HDG and V/S legends when in attitude mode and TRK and FPA legends when in flight
        path mode.</para>
        <para>The altitude window contains the next applicable clearance altitude selected by the crew with the target
        altitude knob and is never dashed. Pushing the knob engages a managed mode which guides the aircraft to the
        target altitude while adhering to altitude constraints set in the FMGS. Pulling the knob gives a selected mode
        that disregards these FMGS altitude constraints.</para>
        <para>The VS/FPA knob differs from the other three in that there is no associated managed mode. Pulling this
        knob commands an immediate level off. Negative indications on the FPA/VS display on the FCU indicate
        descent.</para>
        <para>The "EXPED" button temporarily sets speed to best climb or best descent speed in order to expedite towards
        the target altitude.</para>
        <para>The AP buttons engage one or both autopilots. The A/THR button engages or arms the
        autothrust. Disengagement of autopilot or autothrottle may be acheived by pressing a lit button, but this is not
        a recommended procedure.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>FMA</title>
      <para>The Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) is displayed at the top of the PFD. It is split into 5 columns:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Thrust</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Vertical</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Lateral</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Approach capability and DA/MDA</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>FMGS engagement status</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      In certain modes the vertical and lateral columns combine to display "common modes" where the lateral and vertical
      modes are closely linked.</para>
      <para>Each column has three lines. In the first three columns, the first line shows engaged mode, the second line
      shows armed modes and the third line shows reminders or messages.</para>
      <para>When a mode changes, the mode is boxed on the FMA. A star next to a mode indicates a capture phase.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Flight director/ Autopilot</title>
        <para>The flight directors come on automatically when the aircraft is first powered.</para>
        <para>The AP can be used from just after lift off until the end of the landing roll-out. In most cases only one
        autopilot may be engaged at a time. The exception if on a coupled ILS approach, where the second autopilot may
        be engaged after arming approach.</para>
        <para>Autopilots are disconnected by pushing the red pushbutton on either sidestick. Disconnection triggers a
        single aural alert and a temporary master warning with AP OFF message on the E/WD. A second push on the button
        cancels these warnings. Autopilots may also be disconnected by significant movement of the sidestick or rudder
        pedals, or by pushing a lit AP button on the FCU. This is treated as an involuntary disconnection and leads to a
        repeating aural warning and permanent master warning and message.</para>
        <para>When flying manually with reference to the FD, the symbols for each PFD are driven by their on-side
        FGMC.</para>
        <para>When taking off or landing on an ILS equipped runway, the flight director bars are replaced by a vertical
        green yaw bar to assist centerline tracking in LVOs.</para>
        <para>When the bird is displayed, FD indications change to give FPA commands. The objective becomes to centre
        and align the bird with the green triangles at the wing tips. If TRK/VPA is selected when the basic modes are in
        force (HDG/VS), these modes automatically change to TRK and FPA.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Autothrust</title>
        <para>Autothrust modes are automatically linked to AP/FD vertical modes. Autothrust speed mode, where the
        autothrust adjusts thrust to maintain a speed, is linked to trajectory type AP/FD vertical modes. Autothrust
        fixed mode is linked to AP/FD vertical modes where the speed is controlled by adjusting the aircraft
        attitude.</para>
        <para>There are four detents on the throttle quadrant:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry><term>IDLE</term>

          <listitem><para>Give max takeoff or go around thrust.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
        </variablelist></para>
        <para>The thrust levers do not move when autothrust adjustments are made. Instead, the thrust lever position
        controls the maximum thrust available to the autothrust system. It therefore does not operate when the thrust
        levers are at IDLE or in the reverse range.</para>
        <para>The autothrust automatically arms when TOGA or FLEX/MCT is set for takeoff. At this point the thrust is
        still under manual control, indicated my a MAN indication in the FMA thrust segment. The autothrottle engages
        when the thrust levers are set to CL. Engagement is indicated by THR CLB appearing in green in the FMA thrust
        segment and A/THR appearing in the FMA engagement segment. In normal ops, the thrust levers are left at CL until
        retarded in the flare. Increased thrust may, however, be manually selected at any time by advancing the thrust
        levers beyond the CL detent. If an engine failure occurs, the autothrottle range is automatically extended to
        include the range between CL and MCT.</para>
        <para>If autothrust disconnection is desired in flight, retard the thrust levers until the thrust lever position
        symbol roughly matches the present N1, then push the disconnect button on the side of the thrust
        lever. Autothrust may be completely inhibited for the remainder of the flight by holding one of these buttons
        down for more than 15 seconds.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Flight management</title>

        <para>Each FMGC independantly calculates the aircraft position based on data from the ADIRS, the radio
        navigation aids and the GPS receivers. In normal ops, each FMGC uses the average position of the three
        IRSs. This is called Mix IRS. If an IRS fails, each FMGC uses a single IRS, either on-side or IRS3 as
        available. Each IRS also calculates a GPIRS position based on its own position and the average position
        indicated by the two GPS receivers. The FMGC uses only one of the three GPIRS positions which is automatically
        selected according to merit. The GPIRS data is subjected to integrity criteria, and if it fails, the GPS mode is
        rejected and the system falls back on radio position updating based on on-side auto-tuned radio navigation aids
        (DME,VOR and ILS). If this occurs, an amber GPS PRIMARY LOST message appears in the ND and the MCDU
        scratchpad.</para>

        <para>The FMGC continually calculates a vector, known as BIAS, which represents the offset of the GPIRS or radio
        position (as available) from Mix IRS. The last known value of this vector is used to calculate the aircraft
        position if GPS and radio data become unavailable.</para>

        <para>The FMGC also calculates an estimated position error (EPE) for RNP navigation purposes. EPE and FMGS
        database derived RNP are displayed on the MDCU. An ACCUR value is also provided. This is usually HIGH, but
        indicates LOW if EPE&gt;RNP. If ACCUR is LOW, a RNPA NAV ACCUR DOWNGRAD warning is shown on the ND. If this
        occurs, or if GPS PRIMARY is lost, FM position should be manually cross checked with raw data. If the position
        is within 3nm, the FM position may continue to be used, but hourly raw data checks should be made.</para>

        <para>The FMGS allows both a primary and a secondary flight plan to be entered. The secondary flight plan can be
        quickly activated when required.</para>

        <para>When flying in NAV mode the aircraft is guided on a leg defined by a from and to waypoint. The to waypoint
        is shown in white on the MCDU and in the top right corner of the ND.</para>

        <para>The flight plan is entered using the INIT page on the MCDU. It may be entered using a company route, a
        departure detination pair and manual entry of route or by sending a request for an active F-PLN
        initialization.</para>

        <para>CLB is always associated to ALT mode. ALT will appear in the armed line in magenta if climb restrictions
        are associated with waypoints in the flight plan, otherwise it will appear in blue.</para>
        <para>In DES mode, if the aircraft becomes high, the FMS prediction for regaining the profile assumes that half
        speed brakes will be extended.</para>
        <para>When the aircraft reaches the cruise altitude set in the MCDU, ALT CRZ is displayed in the FMA. If the
        aircraft levels off prior to reaching this level, ALT is displayed.</para>
        <para>RWY lateral mode provides lateral guidance from the start of the takeoff roll up to 30ft if a suitable LOC
        signal is available.</para>
        <para>SRS (speed reference system) vertical mode provides vertical guidance up to acceleration altitude. As long
        as slats are extended and V<subscript>2</subscript> is available to the FMS, SRS engages automatically when
        power is applied for takeoff. It commands a speed of V<subscript>2</subscript>+10 during normal operations. If
        an engine fails, V<subscript>2</subscript> is commanded. SRS also maintains a minimum rate of climb without
        regard to speed control to provide windshear protection.  At acceleration altitude SRS is automatically replaced
        by CLB mode, which accelerates the aircraft to initial climb speed.</para>
        <para>NAV mode engages automatically at 30ft provided a RWY and SID have been inserted in the flight
        plan.</para>
        <para>Thrust reduction is indicated by a flashing LVR CLB message in the message area of the FMA thrust
        segment. Thrust levers must be manually moved to the CLB detent, wherupon the autothrottle will engage.</para>
        <para>The localiser may be intercepted in NAV mode providing that accuracy is HIGH (i.e. epe&gt;rnp) or GPS is

        <para>In order to arm approach, the ILS and RA must be serviceable, both ILS receivers must be tuned to the same
        frequency and have the same course and the aircraft must be above 400ft. G/S* will generally not engage unless
        LOC* or LOC modes are active.</para>
        <para>If the ILS ground transmitter becomes unserviceable during an approach, the deviation bars are removed,
        and the FD bars flash. The AP does, however, remain engaged in G/S and LOC modes.</para>
        <para>If the aircraft suffers a dual ILS receiver failure, the deviation bars are replaced by failure flags, the
        guidance reverts to basic modes and the autopilot trips out.</para>
        <para>LAND mode engages below 400ft when LOC and G/S modes are engaged. When LAND mode is engaged, inputs on the
        FCU are disregarded. It can only be disengaged by a go-around.</para>
        <para>FLARE mode engages at 40ft. The FD bars are replaced by the yaw bar and the AP/FD commands a suitable

        <para>The FMGS allows non precision approaches to be flown in managed mode as long as the approach is available
        in the nav database and the required aids and courses are manually set in the MCDU RADIO NAV page. Unless GPS
        PRIMARY is displayed, accuracy must be checked against raw data. Also, selected modes must be used if accuracy
        is LOW. The managed mode approach is armed with the APPR pb. If the lateral mode at this time is NAV, APP NAV
        will immediately engage. Otherwise it will arm, and will engage following the standard rules of NAV
        engagement. The vertical mode will arm FINAL and the FINAL APPR combined mode will engage when the preplanned
        decent path is intercepted. A V/DEV scale to the right of the attitude indicator then shows deviations from this
        path. The FINAL APPR mode disengages at MDA-50ft or 400ft AGL if MDA was not entered.</para>

          <para>The A/THR will not fly speeds below V<subscript>ls</subscript>, even if selected by the pilot.</para>
          <para>When between 100ft and 2000ft and in configuration 2,3 or FULL, a drop in speed that is significantly
          below V<subscript>ls</subscript>, taking into account deceleration rate and flight path angle, will trigger a
          repetetive "SPEED, SPEED, SPEED aural warning.</para>
          <para>If angle of attack increases above a given threshold known as the alpha floor and the aircraft is above
          100ft, the A/THR engages in A FLOOR mode and commands TOGA thrust. This occurs even if the A/THR is turned
          off. Alpha floor protection is usually available from lift off until 100ft RA on approach, but may be lost in
          cases of multiple failures and when an engine-out occurs above CONF 1. When A FLOOR mode exits, TOGA LK mode
          engages which locks the thrust at TOGA without regard to thrust lever position. To regain control of the
          thrust, the auto-throttle must be disengaged.</para>

          alert and a red WINDSHEAR message is displayed on the attitude indicator.</para>
          <para>When SRS mode is engaged a minimum rate of climb is commanded regardless of speed. If the angle of

          <title>Mode reversions</title>
          <para>When an altitude that is lower than the current altitude is selected during climb or an altitude higher
          than the current altitude is selected during descent, the vertical mode reverts to VS at the current rate of
          climb or descent.</para>
          <para>If the lateral mode is changed from a managed to an unmanaged mode when the vertical mode is CLB, it
          will revert to OP CLB. The aircraft attitude will not change, but altitude constraints will be lost. Similarly
          a change to unmanaged lateral mode in descent leads to DES changing to VS with the current rate of
          descent. Again, aircraft attitude is unchanged.</para>
          <para>With FDs engaged and AP disengaged, if failure to follow flight director commands with the A/THR in THR
          IDLE mode results in speed dropping to V<subscript>ls</subscript>-2kt (V<subscript>ls</subscript>-17kt with
          speedbrakes extended), the flight director bars are removed. This causes the A/THR mode to revert to SPEED and
          the target speed to be recaptured. Similarly, if the aircraft speed reaches V<subscript>max</subscript>+4kt
          with the A/THR in THR CLB mode, the A/THR will revert to SPEED to recapture the target speed.</para>

        <para>The air conditioning system is controlled by two dual lane air conditioning system controllers. They
        provide inputs to the pack flow control valves, the packs, the hot air pressure regulating valve (controller 1),
        the cockpit trim air valve (controller 1) and the cabin trim air valve (controller 2). There is no effect from a
        single lane failure, as the backup lane takes over all duties.</para>

        <para>The pack flow control valves regulate flow of warm pre-conditioned air (originating from the pneumatic
        system) to the packs. They are pneumatically operated, electrically controlled and spring loaded to the closed
        position. They automatically close when a pack overheats, during starting or when either the fire or ditching
        push buttons are pressed. They can also be manually closed by pushing the related PACK button (<xref
        linkend="air-conditioning-controls"/> (3)). The amber light in this button indicates valve position disagreement
        or pack overheat (monitored at compressor outlet and pack outlet).</para>

        <para>The PACK FLOW selector (<xref linkend="air-conditioning-controls"/> (4)) allows the selection of flow rate
        from 80% to 120%. If only one pack is in use or the APU is supplying bleed air, the system will deliver high
        flow regardless of this selection.</para>

        <para>Each pack consist of an air cycle machine and a ram air duct for the heat exchangers. The air cycle
        machine turbine also drives a cooling fan that draws cool air over the heat exchangers. Temperature in the pack
        is regulated by bypassing air around the air cycle machine via a turbine by-pass valve and by modulating the ram
        air intake flaps. These flaps are closed during take-off (take-off power set, main gear struts compressed) and
        landing (main gear struts compressed, speed above 70kt until speed less than 70kt for 20 seconds) to avoid FOD
        ingestion. In the event of failure of the air cycle machine the pack may still be operated with reduced flow
        using the heat exchanger only.</para>

        <para>The cooled air from the packs is then fed into a mixer unit where it is mixed with recirculated air from
        the cabin.  The mixer then supplies air to three independent zones, the cockpit, the forward cabin and the aft
        cabin.</para>

        <para>Temperature requirements of between 18°C and 30°C are set on the air conditioning panel (<xref
        linkend="air-conditioning-controls"/> (1)), and cabin zones may be trimmed ±2.5°C by controls on the forward
        attendants panel. The output temperature for each zone is a function of actual temperature (measured by sensors
        in the cockpit and in the lavatory extraction circuit and galley ventilation systems) and demanded
        temperature. Controller 1 regulates cockpit temperature and controller 2 regulates cabin temperature. The packs
        are controlled to provide air at the lowest temperature required, then the temperature of the other zones is
        trimmed by mixing in hot air that has bypassed the packs via the hot air pressure regulating valve and trim air
        valves. If temperature requirements cannot be met the system will attempt to increase flow. If LO flow is
        selected, the system will override to NORM flow. The system can also increase flow by increasing bleed pressure
        by requesting increases in engine minimum idle or APU flow output as required.</para>

        <para>The hot air pressure regulating valve is pneumatically operated, electrically controlled and spring loaded
        to the closed position. It closes automatically in the case of a duct overheat (which also closes the trim
        valves), if either the cockpit trim valve fails or <emphasis>both</emphasis> cabin trim valves fail, or if both
        lanes of a system controller fail. It can be closed manually with the HOT AIR button (<xref linkend=
        "air-conditioning-controls"/> (2)). If the hot air pressure regulating valve fails open, there is no effect as
        the trim valves take over its duties. If it fails closed, optimized regulation is lost and the packs are used
        for all regulation (pack 2 controls to the mean of FWD and AFT temperatures). The amber FAULT light in the HOT
        AIR button indicates duct temperatures in excess of 88°C. It will extinguish once temperature drops below 70°C
        and OFF is selected.</para>

        <para>Control of zone temperature is provided by a Zone Control Computer. This computer controls the trim valves
        and provides data to the pack controllers. It is dual channel. Failure of a single channel gives a ALTN MODE
        indication on the ECAM COND page. If a dual channel failure occurs, there is no trimming and zone temperature is
        purely a function of pack outlet temperature. A dual channel failure produces a PACK REG legend on the ECAM COND
        page, with amber crosses shown for the trim system and zone temperatures.</para>

        <para>The mixer may also be supplied with ram air. This is controlled with the RAM AIR push button (<xref
        linkend="air-conditioning-controls"/> (5)) and is used in the case of double pack failure or smoke removal. A
        check valve located in the ram air duct opens only when cabin differential is less than 1 psi, thus preventing
        backflow if the cabin is pressurised. The RAM AIR push button also opens the outflow valve to approx. 50% if the
        outflow valve is under automatic control and differential pressure is less than 1 psi.  Since operation of the
        ram air valve leads to aircraft depressurisation, it should not normaly be operated above FL100/MORA. Opening
        of the ram air duct is inhibited if the DITCHING button has been pressed. When parked, low pressure conditioned
        air may be fed into the ram air duct to allow ground conditioning. The packs must be turned off when LP ground
        air is used.</para>

        ventilation controller.</para>
        <para>Cargo compartment heating is provided by hot bleed air that enters via a trim air valve. This valve is
        controlled by a cargo heating controller. The bleed air source for trimming the forward hold is the same duct

      <para>The electrical system consists of a three phase 115/200V 400Hz AC system and a 28V DC system.</para>
      
      <para>Primary AC supply is from two 90 KVA engine driven integrated drive generators (IDGs). Each IDG has an
      associated generator control unit (GCU) which provides frequency, voltage and generator line contactor (GLC)
      control. An third 90 KVA generator is driven by the APU. This generator, along with ground power, is controlled by
      the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU). Each of the three main generators is capable of supplying the
      power requirements of the entire system. The generators cannot be connected in parallel, and are automatically
      brought on line according to priority rules. The IDGs are highest priority, followed by EXT PWR when connected,
      followed by the APU generator.</para>

      <para>A 5KVA hydraulically powered (blue system) constant speed emergency AC generator and associated GCU provide
      power in the event of failure of normal sources. In addition a 1KVA static inverter supplies emergency power to
      part of the AC essential bus if the batteries are the only remaining power source.</para>

      <para>Primary DC power is provided by two 200A transformer rectifier units with automatic protection circuits that
      disconnect the TR in the event of overheat or minimum current. A third identical TR, the "essential"
      TR provides power for the DC Essential bus in the event of loss of all normal AC generators (the Ess Tr is capable
      of drawing power from the emergency AC generator) or in the event of loss of one of both of the main TRs.</para>

      <para>Two 23Ah batteries are also provided for emergency DC power. Each has an associated battery charger limiter
      (BCL) to monitor charging and control its battery contactor. The minimum required offline battery voltage is
      25.5V. If the battery voltage is below minimum, they can be recharged by connecting the batteries to the battery
      bus and applying external power for approximately 20 minutes. In the event of failure of all other power sources,
      the batteries can provide emergency power for approximately 30 minutes.</para>

      <para>Two types of CB are fitted. Monitored CBs are green and trigger ECAM warning messages when out for more
      than one minute. Non-monitored CBs are black and do not cause ECAM warnings. The Wing Tip Brakes (WTB) CBs have
      red caps to prevent them being reset.</para>

      <para>In normal flight, the AC Busses are supplied via a their associated generator and the AC Ess Bus is supplied
      from AC Bus 1 (i.e. AC Ess feed 2 is open). TR1 supplies DC Bus 1, the battery bus and the DC essential bus, and
      TR2 supplies DC Bus 2 (i.e. DC Tie Cont 2 is open). When battery charging is required the BCL closes the required
      battery contactor to connect the battery to the DC Bat Bus.</para>

      <para>If a single engine driven generator is lost, the system will automatically replace it with the APU generator
      if available, or else it will shed part of the galley load and route power from the other engine driven
      generator. If all main generators are lost, AC Bus 1 and AC Bus 2 are lost. If aircraft speed is sufficiently high
      (&gt; 100kt) a ram air turbine (RAT) automatically deploys. This powers the blue hydraulic system which, in turn,
      powers the emergency AC generator. Once this generator is online (approx 8 seconds for RAT deployment and
      generator coupling), it powers the AC Ess bus, the Ess TR and hence the DC Ess bus. If the RAT stalls or the
      aircraft speed is below 100kt, the AC Shed ESS and DC shed ESS buses are shed and the remains of the essential
      system are powered via the batteries and static inverter. Once on the ground, the DC bus is automatically
      connected to the batteries below 100kt and the AC Ess Bus is shed below 50kt.</para>

      <para>A "smoke configuration" is provided that sheds 75% of electrical equipment, the remaining 25% being
      controlled by easily accessible CBs on the overhead panel (with the exception of equipment attached to the hot
      busses). It is essentially the same as for the loss of all main generators, except the fuel pumps are connected
      upstream of the Gen 1 line connector.</para>

      <para>If AC bus 1 fails, the power for the AC Ess bus is routed from AC bus 2 by pressing the AC Ess feed
      pushbutton. TR1 is lost causing the Ess TR to supply the DC Ess bus and, after a 5 second delay, DC bus 2 to
      provide power to DC bus 1.</para>
      
      <para>If both main TRs are lost, DC Bus 1, DC Bus 2 and the DC Bat bus are lost. The DC Ess bus is powered by the
      Ess TR.</para>

      <para>With the engines shut down on the ground, either the APU or external power may be used to supply the entire
      system. In addition, external power can supply the AC and DC GND/FLT buses directly without supplying the entire
      system using the MAINT BUS switch in the forward entrance area.</para>

      <title>Communications</title>
      <para>Three radio management panels (RMP), two on the center pedestal and one on the overhead panel, and three
      audio control panels (ACP), each located next to an RMP, control radio communications. The RMPs also provide a
      backup for radio nav aid tuning.</para>
      <para>Each RMP can tune any communication radio. Usually, however, RMP1 is dedicated to VHF1, RMP2 to VHF2 and
      RMP3 to VHF3 or HF. A white SEL light illuminates when a radio that is not dedicated to an RMP is selected. Note
      that the standby frequency is specific to the RMP, not the radio currently being tuned.</para>
      <para>The ACPs incorporate SELCAL and interphone call alerts. When any of these calls occurs, a buzzer sounds and
      the relevant transmit button flashes amber. The RESET button is used to silence these alerts. The VOICE key
      supresses a nav aid's ident so that voice transmissions can be heard more clearly.</para>
      <para>A CALLS panel situated in the left lower corner of the overhead panel.The MECH button illuminates a light on
      the external power panel and sounds an external horn. Pressing either the FWD or AFT buttons causes a high/low
      chime in the cabin and a "CAPTAIN CALL" message to appear at the selected cabin station. The ALL button does the
      same, except the message appears at all cabin stations. Activation of the emergency call system, either initiated
      by the flight crew by pressing the EMER button or initiated by the cabin crew, causes the CALL light in the EMER
      button to flash amber and the ON light to flash white. If the call is to the cabin, three high/low chimes sound in
      the cabin. If it is from the cabin, three long buzzers sound on the flight deck.</para>
      <para>The CVR, when activated, records the last two hours of communications and aural warnings from the
      cockpit. It is controlled from the RCDR panel. In AUTO mode, it runs for five minutes after power is applied to
      the aircraft, then automatically shuts down. It then restarts after first engine start and continues running until
      five minutes after the last engine has been shut down. Pushing the GND CTL pushbutton manually powers the CVR on
      the ground. The CVR ERASE and CVR TEST buttons are inhibited unless GND CTL is ON, the aircraft is on the ground
      and the parking brake is set. Pushing the CVR ERASE button for two seconds erases the CVR recording. Pushing the
      CVR TEST button sounds a tone through the loudspeakers if the CVR is serviceable.</para>
      <para>The system monitors the communication radios and will produce an ECAM warning if there is continuous

      gear bay.</para>
      <para>To start the APU, first press the master switch button, then the start button. The start sequence begins
      when the APU inlet flap is fully open.</para>
      <para>To shut down the APU, turn off the master switch. If the APU bleed has been used, the shutdown sequence
      incorporates a delay of between 60 and 120 seconds before shutting down. As long as the AVAIL light is still
      displayed, the shut down sequence can be cancelled by turning the master switch back on. If APU bleed has not been
      used, the shutdown is immediate.</para>
      <para>The APU control is completely automatic. Auto-shutdown is available whenever the APU is running. Automatic
      deployment of the APU extinguisher is also available on the ground. APU emergency shutdown is initiated by
      pressing the APU fire button or by pressing the APU SHUT OFF button on the external panel. An APU fire in flight
      will show the APU FIRE procedure on the ECAM, followed by the APU EMER SHUT procedure. On the ground, a fire will
      cause the APU AUTO SHUT DOWN procedure to be shown after the APU fire procedure.</para>
      <para>The LOW OIL LEVEL on the ECAM indicates that the APU can only be used for a further 10 hours before
      maintenance is required. The amber FUEL LOW PR indication occurs during start if fuel pressure is low. It is only
      an advisory.</para>

      integral lighting and emergency lights are fitted to the aircraft below the overwing exits to illuminate the route
      to the slide. Red handles are fitted to the sides of the slide near the bottom to allow the slide to be used as a
      rag slide in case of pressure loss. The main door slides have a white handle under the girt bar cover that allows
      the slide to be quickly detached from the aircraft. It will remain attached to the aircraft by a tether, and a knife
      is provided to cut this tether. In case of ditching, it is possible to transport a slide from an inoperative door

        <title>Engine and APU</title>
        <para>Each engine has an identical fire detection system, comprising two parallel detection loops monitored by a
        fire detection unit (FDU). Normally, both loops must indicate a fire to produce a warning. The loops are
        monitored and automatically disabled if they malfunction. Loss of a single loop produces a level 1 ECAM
        warning. Loss of both loops, or loss of an FDU, leads to a level 2 ECAM warning indicating loss of fire
        detection capability on that engine. If both loops break within 5 seconds, a fire warning is triggered. Each
        engine has a guarded fire button on the overhead fire panel.  This lights up to provide fire indications. When
        pushed, the fire button pops out as a physical indication of activation. Pushing the fire button arms the squibs
        and closes the following on the affected engine:

        detectors and forwards them to the FWC which displays warnings on the CARGO SMOKE panel. If smoke is detected,
        the inlet and exhaust valves for the affected cargo bay are automatically closed. A single fire bottle is
        provided for both compartments. The aft compartment has two nozzles, and the forward compartment only one. When
        a DISCH button is pushed on the CARGO SMOKE panel, the bottle is completely emptied into the selected
        compartment. Smoke warnings will not extinguish once a fire is extinguished as the smoke will remain isolated in
        the cargo compartment and the smoke detectors are sensitive to the extinguishing agent.</para>

      <title>Ice &amp; rain protection</title>
      <para>The three outboard slats of each wing are anti iced using hot bleed air. This is controlled by the WING
      button on the anti-ice panel.</para>
      <para>The engine air intakes are anti iced using an independent air bleed, routing hot air from the high pressure
      compressor via an engine anti-ice valve to the intake. These are controlled by the ENG1 and ENG2 buttons on the
      anti-ice panel. The anti-ice valve fails open if electrical power is removed. When switched on, the FAULT light
      illuminates during valve transit, then extinguishes. When switched on, the ignitors are automatically switched on
      and idle N1 will increase. The memos IGNITION and ENG A.ICE will appear on the E/WD.</para>
      <para>The fan blades are not anti-iced. If significant engine vibrations occur due to icing, the fan ice can be
      shed by running the engines up to 70% N2 for approximately 15 seconds.</para>
      <para>Wing anti-ice is controlled by a single WING button controlling anti ice for both wings. APU bleed air must
      not be used for wing anti-icing. During valve transit, the amber FAULT light in the button will illuminate. Wing
      anti-icing also increases idle N1. A WING A.ICE memo on the E/WD and two ANTI ICE legends (with green triangles
      indicating valve open) on the ECAM bleed page indicate wing anti-ice is on. If the green triangle is present
      without an accompanying ANTI ICE legend, it means that the valve has stuck open. When armed on the ground, the
      wing anti-ice will activate for 30 seconds as a self test, then change to an armed mode where the valves are
      closed but will automatically open when airborne (indications as above with green triangles removed).</para>
      <para>If ice detection is installed, the ICE NOT DET memo indicates that no ice has been detected for three

      <para>The AOA probes, the TAT probes, the pitot probes and the static ports are elecrically heated. This is
      controlled by the same button as the window heat.</para>
      <para>On the ground, the probes (TAT excepted) and windows are heated automatically after starting the first
      engine when the PROBE/WINDOW HEAT button is set to AUTO. The windshield heating operates at low power on the
      ground. Pressing the button allows for manual defog/ de-ice of the windows.</para>
      <para>The water drain masts are electrically heated. This heat is reduced when on the ground.</para>
      <para>The optional ice detection system consists of two ice detectors on the lower fuselage and a visual ice

      <para>The nose gear is equipped with a nose wheel steering system</para>
      <para>All the gear and gear doors are hydraulically operated. They are controlled electrically by two Landing Gear
      Control and Interface Units (LGCIU), which also supply monitoring information.</para>
      <para>The landing gear can be manually extended using the landing gear gravity extension handle located on the
      center pedestal.</para>
      <para>There are four braking modes:

      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>Normal braking is powered by the green hydraulic system. The other modes are powered by the yellow hydraulic
      system.</para>
      <para>The parking brake (and alternate brake system) is supplied by the yellow hydraulic system, backed up by an
      accumulator. The green arc on the accumulator gauge indicates that parking brake pressure will be maintained for
      at least 12 hours. If accumulator pressure is low, the yellow electric hydraulic pump can be used to charge
      it. Note that due to PTU operation, this will power up both the yellow and green hydraulic systems.</para>
      <para>Brake wear indicators must be checked with the parking brake on.</para>
      <para>The steering handwheels provide 75° of nose wheel deflection. If inputs are made on both handwheels, they
      are summed. The rudder pedals provide up to 6° deflection at low speeds, progressively decreasing to zero as speed
      increases to 130kt. The rudder pedal disconnect switch disconnects the nose wheel steering from the rudder so that
      the rudder pedals can be checked.</para>
      <para>During gear retraction, the main gear is automatically braked. The nose gear is braked by a brake
      band.</para>
      
      <para>The L/G CTL message on the ECAM wheels page indicates a discrepancy between demanded landing gear position
      and actual position.</para>
      <para>The gear is monitored by two Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIU). Indications are displayed on
      the ECAM WHEEL page and the LDG GEAR indicator. On the ECAM page, each gear is represented by two triangles, one
      per LGCIU. When down and locked, the triangles are green. When unlocked, the triangles are red. When fully
      retracted, the triangles are not shown. A green indication on either triangle is sufficient to determine that the
      gear is down and locked. The lights on the LDG GEAR indicator panel are controlled by LGCIU1. An UPLOCK message on
      the ECAM WHEEL page indicates that the landing gear is down and locked with an uplock engaged.</para>

      <para>The auto brake is automatically disengaged when the landing gear reaches the fully retracted
      position.</para>
      <para>Gravity extension of the landing gear is possible by turning the GEAR EXTN hand crank clockwise
      approximately three times. This procedure is detailed in the QRH. After gravity extension, the gear doors remain
      open. This also has the effect of disabling nosewheel stearing.</para>
      <para>When the landing gear is extended in flight, green dashes appear on the ECAM wheel page to indicate
      anti-skid available. These will indicate anti-skid commands on landing.</para>
      <para>The AUTO BRK message on the ECAM WHEEL page indicates autobrakes armed. This only appears below 800ft
      AGL. When aircraft deceleration is at least 80% of the selected rate, the DECEL light in the AUTO/BRK selector
      illuminates. MAX mode is only used for takeoff. Autobrake may be deselected by pushing the corresponding button or
      by manual braking.</para>
      <para>After landing, if the brake temperatures on one gear differ by more than 150°C or the difference in the mean
      temperature of each gear exceeds 200°C, maintenance action is required.</para>

      <para>If any brake is &gt;100°C, a green arc appears on the ECAM page. This indicates that the brake fan must be
      switched on. If the temperature exceeds 300°C, an amber arc appears, indicating that takeoff must be delayed to
      let the brakes cool.</para>

        <para>Two Flight Control Data Concentrator computers (FCDC) process data from the ELACs and SECs for use by the
        EIS. The FACs send their data directly. The FCDCs are redundant. Failure of both FCDCs will lead to flight
        control data not being available to the EIS.</para>
        <para>Two FLT CTL panels, one on either side of the overhead panel, are used to control the flight control
        computers.</para>
        <para>Each pair of flight control computers is redundant. The SEC3 is only used for spoiler control, and
        does not participate in flight control system reconfiguration.</para>
        <para>The ailerons, elevators and pitch trim are powered by two independent actuators, each powered by a
        seperate hydraulic source. The rudder is powered by three independent actuators. Each actuator is controlled by
        a different computer. At any one time, one actuator will be in active mode, and the other will be in damping
        mode. In the event of a flight control computer failure, the actuators controlled by that computer will
        automatically be switched to damping mode, and those controlled by the other computer will become active.</para>
        <para>If both ELACs fail, active control of the ailerons is lost and they revert to damping mode. SEC2 takes
        over control of the elevators and the stabilizer. Roll function is provided by the spoilers. If SEC2 also fails,
        it will be replaced by SEC1.</para>
        <para>With an elevator fault, the remaining elevator remains operative, but its deflection limits are reduced to
        prevent excessive torsional loads on the tail. Normal flight is possible in this configuration. If the elevators
        are lost entirely, they are automatically set to the neutral position.</para>
        <para>Providing suitable hydraulic power is available, mechanical control of the stabiliser and rudder is always
        available.</para>
        <para>Each spoiler is fitted with a single actuator. If a hydraulic system fails, its associated spoiler will
        remain in its last position unless pushed down by aerodynamic forces. Spoiler control is shared by the three
        SECs. Failures are shown on the ECAM F/CTL page by an amber number above the failed spoiler. An amber triangle
        above the number indicates a failure in the extended position. If possible, the spoiler will be automatically
        retracted by its controlling SEC and then it and its symmetrical pair on the opposite wing will be
        inhibited.</para>
        <para>Under certain conditions, speed brake extension is inhibited and spoilers are automatically
        retracted. This may lead to a SPD BRK DISAGREE ECAM caution.</para>

        <para>Auto ground spoilers are armed by pulling the spoiler lever up to expose a white collar. A memo on the
        E/WS confirms arming.</para>
        <para>Rudder trim is isolated in flight when the autopilot is engaged. Its position is shown by a blue line on
        the ECAM F/CTL page.</para>
        <para>When the autopilot is engaged, speed brakes will not deploy past approximately half, even if the speed
        brake lever is moved to full.</para>
        <para>The "SPEED BRK" memo on the E/WD will flash amber if speed brakes are extended and any engine is above
        idle.</para>
        <para>Auto ground spoilers deploy automatically when both main gear are compressed and thrust levers are at idle
        or behind. If only one main gear is compressed, the spoilers only partially deploy. They will automatically
        retract if power is applied for a go-around.</para>
        <para>Lift augmentation devices consist of:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>Five slats on each leading edge</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Two flaps on each trailing edge</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>The lift augmentation devices are hydraulically actuated. They are electrically controlled by two Slat
        Flap Control Computers (SFCC). Each SFCC has two channels, one for the slats and one for the flaps. The SFCCs
        are redundant, but a system associated with a failed channel will move at half speed.</para>
        <para>When flaps are selected, both ailerons are dropped by about 5°. This is indicated on the ECAM F/CTL page
        by the aileron position indicatord pointing to a boxed position on the scale rather than there normal double
        dashed position.</para>

        <para>The flaps have an auto retract function. In configuration 1+F, the flaps will automatically retract when
        airspeed reaches 210kt. There is no corresponding automatic slat retraction, so this is known as configuration
        1.</para>

        <para>When deploying flaps when airborne, selecting 1 on the flap lever only moves the slats -
        i.e. configuration 1 is acheived rather than 1+F.</para>

        <para>Flap and slat faults are indicated in amber on the flap/ slat display on the E/WD. Locked flaps or slats
        may be caused by the Wing Tip Brakes (WTB) locking the affected surface movement if assymmetry, overspeed,
        symmetrical runaway or uncommanded movement are detected. WTBs cannot be released in flight. The slats and flaps
        have independant WTBs, so locked flaps will not cause locked slats, and vice versa. An ALIGNMENT FAULT indicates
        flap attachment failure.</para>

        <para>A-LOCK pulsing blue on the E/WD indicates that the slats have been locked due to high angle of attack
        and/or low speed.</para>

        <para>The rudder deflection is limited depending on speed by the rudder travel limiter. The current rudder
        travel limit is shown on the F/CTL ECAM page by white ticks below the rudder scale.</para>

        <title>Side sticks</title>
        <para>The side sticks are spring loaded to neutral and do not provide feedback. They are not interconnected. If
        both side sticks are operated at the same time, their inputs are added algebraically. If this happens, a "DUAL
        INPUT" aural warning is activated and green lights show on the SIDE STICK PRIORITY warning lights. Dual inputs
        are not recommended.</para>
        <para>When the autopilots are engaged, the side sticks are locked in neutral. If the lock is overcome, the
        autopilot is disconnected.</para>
        <para>The button on the side stick is dual function. If an autopilot is engaged, pushing the button will
        disconnect the autopilot and pushing it a second time will silence the associated warning. If no autopilot is
        engaged, pressing and holding the button prioritises the side stick. This results in a "PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT"
        message and a red arrow indication on the opposite side stick priority warning light. Moving the low priority
        sidestick now just results in a green light in the side stick priority light on the prioritised side. If both
        priority buttons are pushed, the last pressed will give priority. The opposite sidestick can be permanently
        deactivated by pressing and holding the button for 40 seconds. In this case, a momentary push on either button
        will reactivate the deactivated side stick.</para>
        <para>On the ground, a combined side stick deflection indicator is shown as a white cross on the attitude
        indicator. This only indicates side stick positions, not control surface positions. Control surface positions
        are shown on the ECAM F/CTL page, which is automatically called if either the sidesticks or the rudder pedals
        are moved on the ground. The side sticks become operable on the ground as soon as hydraulic power becomes
        available (i.e. after first engine start).</para>

        side stick input is a rate of roll demand in roll and a load factor demand in pitch. Control surface movement
        will occur with no input on the side stick. An attitude is set with the sidestick and the sidestick is then
        allowed to return to its neutral position. As pitch and roll rate demands are now zero, the flight control
        computer holds the attitude until further inputs are made with the sidestick. Yaw control is
        conventional, but turn co-ordination and dutch roll protection are provided, meaning rudder inputs are not
        generally required.</para>

          <para>Load factor limitation is provided similarly to normal law. Pitch attitude protection is lost, indicated
          by the green pitch limit dashes on the attitude indicator being replaced by amber crosses. Bank angle
          protection is lost. Again, this is indicated by the green dashes on the bank angle scale being replaced by
          amber crosses.</para>

          <para>The high angle of attack protection is replaced by low speed stability. Stall warning speed,
          V<subscript>SW</subscript> indicated by a red baber pole on the speed indicator replaces the
          V<subscript>&alpha;</subscript> indications. As speed approaches V<subscript>SW</subscript> a progressive nose
          down pitch input is introduced. This can be overridden with side stick inputs. A "STALL,STALL" aural warning
          sounds at V<subscript>SW</subscript>, and the aircraft will stall if the warning is ignored. Alpha floor
          protection is also inoperative in alternate law.</para>

          <para>High speed stability replaces high speed protection. A nose up input is added when speed is above
          V<subscript>MO</subscript>/M<subscript>MO</subscript>. This can be overridden with sidestick inputs. As in
          normal law, an aural over speed warning is triggerred when
          V<subscript>MO</subscript>/M<subscript>MO</subscript> is exceeded.</para>
          
          <para>According to the failures, it is possible that the stabilities will also be lost. In this case only load

          <title>Direct law</title>
          <para>Direct law is indicated by the ECAM message FCTL DIRECT LAW (PROT LOST). In direct law, there is a
          direct relationship between side stick and control surface positions. There are no protections available,
          although stall and over speed warnings are still available. Auto-trim is not available. A "USE MAN PITCH TRIM"
          message appears on the FMA. Auto turn coordination and dutch roll damping are also lost.</para>

          <para>Pitch is controlled solely through the use of manual pitch trim. "MAN PITCH TRIM ONLY" appears on the

      <para>When the centre tank pumps are in AUTO, they turn off when slats are selected. The centre tank pumps also
      shut off automatically when the wing tanks have been filled by fuel returning from the IDG cooling circuits. In
      this case, they automatically restart when approx 500kg of fuel fas been burnt from the wing tanks. The centre
      tank pumps produce slightly higher pressure than the wing pumps, so that centre tank fuel will be used first.</para>
      <para>When either inner tank reaches a low level, both transfer valves open automatically, and fuel is transferred
      to the inner tanks. This is indicated by the E/WD memo "OUTER TK FUEL XFRD". The transfer valves, once open,
      remain open until the next refuelling operation.</para>
      <para>The external refuel panel is situated on the fuselage below the right wing. A single refuelling point is
      installed on the right wing outboard of the engine. A REFUELG memo on the E/WD indicates that this panel is
      open.</para>
      <para>There is a surge tank fitted in each wingtip to protect against overpressure and thermal expansion. There
      are no cockpit indications. The surge tank vent is situated underneath the wing near the tip.</para>
      <para>A shroud drain mast is situated under the fuselage. This drains any fuel that leaks from the system.</para>
      <para>Each tank has a magnetic fuel level indicator to allow fuel to be measured manually. These should normally

      manually.</para>
      <para>Failure of a single wing pump will not trigger a master caution, since there is a backup pump
      available. Failure of both pumps in one wing tank will mean that the fuel in the tank must be gravity fed,
      potentially reducing the service ceiling of the aircraft.</para>
      <para>Degradation of a fuel quantity sensor is indicated by two amber dashes across the last two digits of the FOB

      <para>A transfer valve shown in amber indicates the failure of the affected transfer valve. The fuel in the tank
      is unusable in this configuration.</para>

        is adjusting the thrust, a blue arc appears to indicate the final thrust level that is being set. If both
        engines are at idle in flight, an IDLE indication flashes for ten seconds, then remains steady green. N1 in the
        caution range is indicated by a flashing amber needle (digits remain green). In the warning range, the needle
        and the digits turn red. A red line indicates the maximum exceedance in the warning range.</para>
        <para>The current thrust limit mode and N1 rating limit are displayed to the right of the N1 gauges. If a FLX

        <para>Starts are usually carried out automatically by the FADEC. It is, however, possible to start the engine
        manually, with the pilots controlling fuel and ignition. In this case the FADEC only provides passive
        monitoring. When carrying out a manual start, the ENG MAN START buttons control the start valves and the ENG
        MASTER switch activates both ignitors and open the HP fuel cock. The ENG MASTER switch should be turned on at
        max motoring, providing this is &gt;20%. The start valve closure and ignition cutoff still occurs automatically

          <para>Rose NAV mode dispalys a map oriented to the aircraft. The range selector sets the diameter of the
          map. Planned track is shown in green and waypoints are shown in blue. Id, range and ETA for the next waypoint
          are shown in the top right corner.</para>
          <para>Arc mode is the normal mode, displaying the forward 90° of the map shown by rose NAV mode. The range
          selector now sets the distance from the aircraft to the edge of the map.</para>
          <para>Additional data points for airports, NDBs, VORs and Waypoints can be shown in map modes by selecting
          pushbuttons on the EFIS control panel. These data points show in magenta.</para>

          <title>Overview</title>
          <para>Data from certain aircraft system sensors is routed directly to the ECAM channel in the three DMCs. The
          majority of the data, however, is routed to the two System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs), for
          processing. The SDACs then provide system page data to the DMCs. Normally, DMC1 supplies the E/WD, DMC2
          supplies the SD and DMC3 is available as a backup. Two Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) receive data directly
          from aircraft sensors to generate red warnings and receive data from the SDACs to generate amber warnings. The
          FWCs control the attention getters and aural alerts and send data to the DMCs for display of alert
          messages.</para>
          <para>Failure of a single FWC generates a Level 1 caution, since there is a redundant system available. This
          will, however, downgrade the aicraft to Cat III single. It will also lead to only one half of the Master
          Caution and Master Warning lights illuminating. The loss of both FWCs will remove all automatic monitoring of
          the aircraft systems. The ECAM system pages and overhead panels must be monitored for local failure
          indications.</para>
          <para>The EMER CANC button can be used to supress the caution associated with an intermittant nuisance
          warning. Pressing and holding the RCL key for 3 seconds will unsupress the caution.</para>
          <para>Information on the ECAM displays is colour coded:
          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry><term>Green</term>

          </variablelist>
          </para>
          <para>The ECAM system divides the flight into various stages. If a warning occuring in the take-off or landing
          phase can be delayed, it is inhibited until a less critical stage of flight is reached.</para>
          <para>ECAM warnings are presented in various ways depending on severity:
          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry><term>ECAM advisory</term>
            <listitem><para>If a parameter approaches its limit, the relevant SD page is brought up and the parameter
            pulses, but remains green to indicate that no exceedance has yet taken place.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
            <varlistentry><term>Level 1</term>
            <listitem><para>A loss of redundancy or a loss of a system that does not affect the safety of the flight has
            occured. An amber message is displayed on the E/WD. As the fault only requires crew awareness, the handling of
            the fault can be delayed if required. Pressing the CLR key on the ECAM control panel will move the message to
            the status page, which will be brought up. The status page is then reviewed and subsequently removed by
            pressing either a CLR key or the STS key.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
            <varlistentry><term>Level 2</term>
            <listitem><para>A failure that hasn't any direct consequence on flight safety. This is similar to a level 1
            alert, except the crew is alerted by illumination of the master caution light and an aural warning. Pressing
            the master caution light extinguishes it.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
            <varlistentry><term>Level 3</term>
            <listitem><para>A failure that requires immediate crew action. The red master warning illuminates and a
            continuous chime sounds. Pressing the master warning light extinguishes it, stops the chimes and resets the
            alerting system. In this case, the messages shown on the E/WD are in red.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
          </variablelist>
          </para>
          <para>ECAM displays the failure message on the E/WD in order of priority, so that high priority failures are
          dealt with before low priority failures. It is possible that a high priority failure will be placed above a
          failure that you are currently running the actions for.</para>
          <para>A white MAINTENANCE message on the ECAM status page does not mean that the aircraft is unserviceable,
          only that a particular procedure is required at the next programmed servicing.</para>
          <para>A boxed failure indication is a primary failure that has associated secondary failures. The secondary
          failures are indicated in the right hand column by starred items.</para>
        </sect3>
        <sect3>
          <title>E/WD</title>
          <para>The upper area of the E/WD display is used for main engine parameters, fuel on board (FOB) and slat/flap
          positions. The lower part of the E/WD display is normally used to show memos. If a failure occurs, the memos
          are replaced by warning/ caution messages and a series of blue action items. Boxed failures indicate a primary
          failure that will affect other systems. Starred failures on the right of the memo area are secondary
          failures.</para>
          <para>Approximately two minutes after engine start, a takeoff memo appears. The items on this memo put the
          aircraft into a suitable configuration for takeoff.</para>
          <para>During the takeoff phase, a magenta T.O. INHIBIT message appears. This indicates that some warnings and
          cautions are now inhibited. T.O. INHIBIT is in effect from application of T.O. thrust up to 1500ft AAL or 2
          minutes after lift off.</para>
          <para>On passing 1500ft in the descent, a landing memo is displayed.</para>
          <para>At approximately 800ft, a LDG INHIBIT message appears. This indicates that the vast majority of warnings
          and cautions have been inhibited for the landing phase.</para>
        </sect3>
        <sect3>
          <title>SD</title>
          <para>There is a permanent area at the bottom of the SD. This always displays TAT, SAT, time and gross
          weight.</para>
          <para>The SD page automatically provides pilots with information on a "need to know basis".</para>
          <para>An aircraft STATUS page may be displayed to check the state of the aircraft. The content of this page
          varies depending on what failures are present, but may contain limitations, approach procedures, information
          and inoperative systems. If the status page is not clear, a white boxed STS legend appears at the bottom of
          the E/WD display, and, if there are any messages affecting approach and landing, the status page will
          automatically be displayed when the slats are extended. If the status page has a green overflow arrow at the
          bottom, pressing a CLR key will display the next page.</para>
        </sect3>
        <sect3>
          <title>Controls</title>
          <para>The pilot interface for the ECAM display is the ECAM Control Panel on the pedestal. The middle two lines
          of buttons manually bring up their associated ECAM page. When manually selected, the button lights up, and
          pushing it again will remove the page and allow the automatic sequencing of pages.</para>
          <para>The RCL button, when pressed for at least three seconds, recalls any warnings or cautions that have been
          cleared since the last power up. If there is nothing to recall, a NORMAL message will be displayed on the
          E/WD.</para>
          <para>The T.O. CONFIG key is used to carry out a takeoff configuration check prior to takeoff. This simulates
          setting of takeoff power, and generates a warning if the aircraft is not in a proper takeoff
          configuration.</para>
        </sect3>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Reconfiguration</title>
        <para>In general, the PFD has priority over the ND and the E/WD has priority over the SD.</para>
        <para>Normally, DMC1 supplies the Captain's PFD and ND, and the E/WD. DMC2 supplies the FO's PFD and ND, and the
        SD. DMC3 is a backup.</para>
        <para>If a DMC fails, all information is removed from the displays it controls and replaced by a white diagonal
        line to indicate a working display with a failed source. ECAM will detect the failure and provide a sequence of
        alerts.  Due to the priority rules, the E/WD display will move to the lower DU if it was DMC1 that failed. The
        EIS DMC switch is used to replace the failed DMC with DMC3.</para>
        <para>In the event display failures, there will be no white diagonal. The displays have priority rules so that
        the remaining displays are utilised most effectively. The PFDs have priority over the NDs unless a PFD/ND switch
        on the misc panels is pushed. The E/WD has priority over the SD. The ECAM screens can be given priority over an
        ND with the ECAM/ND XFER switch.</para>

        <para>A single screen ECAM mode is available. This displays the E/WD, but can be made to display an SD page for
        a maximum of 30 seconds by pushing and holding the relevant page button on the ECP. If an advisory condition
        occurs, the page is not automatically displayed. Instead the page button lights up and a boxed ADV message is
        shown on the E/WD. If an ECAM warning or caution is triggered, again there is no automatic page display. The
        normal aural and visual indications are given. The underlined word in the warning indicates which SD page needs
        to be viewed. The page should be checked both before and after running the ECAM actions, and the status page
        will have to be called manually. The status page can be displayed for a maximum of three minutes. On the approach,
        the STS message pulses to indicate that the crew should manually call and review the status page.</para>
